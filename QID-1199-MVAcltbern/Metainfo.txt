Published in: Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Description: Illustrates the (univariate) Central Limit Theorem (CLT). n*1000 sets of n-dimensional Bernoulli samples are generated and used to approximate the distribution of t = sqrt(n)*(mean(x)-mu)/sigma -> N(0,1). The estimated density (blue) of t is shown together with the standard normal (red).

Keywords: plot, graphical representation, bernoulli, normal, CLT, density, distribution, standard-normal, asymptotic
