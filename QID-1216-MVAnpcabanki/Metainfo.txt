Name of QuantLet: MVAnpcabanki

Published in: Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Description: Shows a scree plot of the eigenvalues for the PCA of the standardized Swiss bank notes. Additionally, it computes the correlations between the variables and the principal components and displays the first two of them.

Example: 
- 1: Scree plot of the eigenvalues for the PCA of the standardized Swiss bank notes.
- 2: The correlations of the original variables with the PCs.

Note: 'Matlab and SAS decompose matrices differently than R, and therefore some 
      of the eigenvectors may have different signs.'
